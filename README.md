## Installation 

`adm` is designed to run on an ubuntu server. It will probably also work on many other debian-derived systems. You can install it like so:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vankesteren/adm/HEAD/install.sh | sh
```

If you're not a fan of [piping curl to bash](https://sasha.vincic.org/blog/2024/09/piping-curl-to-bash-convenient-but-risky), then download the install script from [here](./install.sh), review it, and run it.
